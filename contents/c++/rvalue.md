## Background
C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was designed for resource-constrained and large systems, high performance and efficiency. The language has been constantly updated and improved after the past decades, with new standards being released periodically. One such standard, the C++11 standard, brought about many changes and improvements, that it made C++ feel like a different language altogether. One such feature that furthur improves on the performance on the language is the introduction of RValue references and Move Semantics.
