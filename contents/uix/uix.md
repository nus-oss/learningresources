# UI/UX

## Overview

User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) are terms often used interchangeably. In fact, these two terms are quickly becoming dangerous buzzwords that are used inaccurately, creating massive confusion in the industry. A simple Google search will show that UI Designer and UX Designer jobs are listed under similar titles and descriptions. 

In addition to helping us identify and apply for the right role, understanding the key differences between UI and UX helps us in using the right concept in our own applications. This document will address the difference between UI and UX as well as some of the techniques used in UI Design and UX Design.

## User Interface vs User Experience

UI is about the design of the buttons, the layout of the website and the responsiveness of the application. It encompasses the presentation and interactivity of the application. On the other hand, UX is concern with the ease of use and the pleasure provided through using the application. In short, UI is about the look and feel while UX is about customer satisfaction.

Due to the overlapping nature of UI and UX, you might still have some questions such as *'Doesn't improving the UI also improve the UX?'* Indeed, it does. In fact, UI **can** be part of UX.

> Note that **can** is used because UI is no longer a necessity to UX due to the emergence of [zero UI](http://blog.careerfoundry.com/ui-design/what-is-zero-ui), which won't be covered here.

To gain a better understanding, let's look at real life examples of good UI but bad UX. A prime example would be the [Mystery Meat Navigation](https://www.techinasia.com/talk/material-design-mystery-meat-navigation-problem) problem. It refers to buttons and links that do not explain themselves; users have to click on them to find out where it leads. In essence, the pursuit of clean and neat UI has resulted in omission of details that provide clarity for the user. This results in bad UX because people do not like to puzzle over how things work. A good UX should never make the user think.

## UI Design

Flat and minimalist design are technically easier to create than realistic design. Thanks to the rise of flat and minimalist design you don't have to be a photoshop expert to get started on UI design. 

A good way to start is by observing existing designs. Use existing UI Designs as references and try to apply the design patterns in your own application. Using [UI design guidelines](http://www.goodui.org/) can help to highlight and avoid common mistakes. Online lessons like [Hack Design](https://hackdesign.org/lessons#graphic-design-principles) also provide a variety of materials covering the basics of UI design. The best thing is that they are free!

Here is a non-exhaustive list of UI design concepts you can choose to dive into if you are interested:

## UX Design

Just like Software Development, UX Design is an iterative process. It involves many stages like researching, planning, testing, and at each stage are many different techniques that you could use. A good place to find these techniques would be the [UX Project Checklist](https://uxchecklist.github.io/) created by Andrea Soverini.

## Which is more important?

The metaphor of building a house by Clayton Yan (UX Designer at UserTesting) illustrates this aptly. UX is the structure (i.e. the number of rooms, one-storey or two-storey and where the front door leads). Meanwhile, UI is about the visual (i.e. whether the same wallpaper or vases is used). A good UX with bad UI is like an ugly house with nice structure. A good UI with bad UX is like a beautiful house with the front door leading straight to the bathroom. To sum it up, UI and UX are **equally** important in creating an awesome experience for the users.
