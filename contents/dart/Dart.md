## What is Dart?
Dart (previously also known as `dartlang`) is an object-oriented, <tooltip content="a style of Object-oriented programming (OOP) in which inheritance occurs via defining classes of objects, instead of inheritance occurring via the objects alone (compare prototype-based programming)">class defined</tooltip>, garbage-collected language using a C-style syntax that <tooltip content="also known as source-to-source compilation">transcompiles</tooltip> optionally into JavaScript. It's rumored that Dart was invented out of Google engineers' frustration with JavaScript (they even built [a version of Chromium browser](https://dartdoc.takyam.com/tools/dartium/) with Dart VM so that Dart code can be run on the web without transcompiling to JavaScript). However, as most developers still stick to JavaScript and it turned out that TypeScript is a much more widely-accepted solution for statically typed JavaScript transcompilation, Dart is then, with the emergence of <tooltip content="a cross-platform mobile UI framework developed by Google">Flutter</tooltip>, re-purposed as a **client-optimized** language that's optimized for **UI creation** and **cross-platform execution**.

## Why Learn Dart?

### Optimized for Declarative UI

<panel header="If you don't know what **declarative UI** is..." minimized>

To be more specific, why is reactive programming, a declarative programming paradigm, important for UI development?

**What is reactive programming?** Consider the expression `a = b + c`, in the world of *imperative programming*, it simply means "calculate the value of `b + c`, assign the result to `a`" - changing the value of `b` or `c` later would not change `a`. However, with reactive programming, you can consider `a` will always evaluate to the result of `b+c` even without you explicitly calling `a=b+c`. Such behavior is especially useful for writing UI - you no longer need to manually update the information displayed with a setter of some kind. Simply *declare* that variable `x` is related to UI element `y`, the runtime will update `y` whenever it detects a change in `x`. In short, reactive programming saves you from the headache of maintaining the consistency between the UI and internal states.

From above, you can see that *reactive programming* is by nature *declarative* as you don't write code to tell computers what to do at each step, you describe what's the expected behavior (e.g. a box should be centered at the screen, a button should turn grey when clicked, etc.). 

In fact, **declarative (and reactive) UI** is an industry trend on all platforms - Android has [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose), iOS has [Swift UI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/), Web has [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), mobile cross-platform has [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).
</panel>

**Dart is optimized for declarative UI.** Dart's syntax allows you to write statically typed code in a JSON-like way, and writing asynchronous code is a breeze in Dart, both of which makes Dart an ideal choice for developing declarative UI.

For the reasons above, Dart is adopted by Flutter, a cross-platform mobile UI framework. <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:flutter_info">(Why Flutter?)</trigger> Not only you shall build Flutter apps using Dart, the Flutter framework itself is written in <tooltip content="platform-dependent channel methods excluded, of course...">pure Dart</tooltip>. In short, Dart is suitable for writing declarative UI, and Dart is a pre-requisite for Flutter.

<modal header="**What's nice (or unique) about Flutter?**" id="modal:flutter_info" center large>
Flutter is open-source, fast-growing and easy-to-learn.
<ul>
<li>Apps written in Flutter runs as a single page application as it renders everything with its own rendering engine - just like most of the mobile games. This approach makes UI consistency a breeze - you can be confident that what you see on Android emulator will be exactly the same when it's published to iOS.</li>
<li>Flutter supports stateful hot reload - your changes to both UI and logic code can be reflected to the running emulator within a second, and the states will be preserved.</li>
<li>Flutter (in release mode) compiles everything to native machine code - unlike some other cross-platform frameworks that makes use of some kind of middleware (e.g. JS Bridge in React Native) to communicate with the native APIs.</li>
</ul>
</modal>

### Fast Development and Native Performance

A programming language usually needs to balance between development speed and performance. Dart is ambitious: it wants to **run fast** on all platforms (which requires compilation to native machine code) while allowing the developers to **live reload code changes** without re-compiling the entire file (which requires a VM of some kind). Thus, Dart has three execution modes for the best of all words:
* for fast development, <tooltip content="Just-in-time">JIT</tooltip> + Dart VM; 
* for native performance: <tooltip content="Ahead-of-time">AOT</tooltip> compilation to platform-specific instructions; 
* for browser support: source-to-source compiler to JavaScript

The flexibility provided by the three execution modes of Dart makes Dart unique in the world of programming languages - there are few languages that maintains three components (i.e. VM, compiler and transpiler). It's a lot of work for the Dart maintainers, but saves a lot of work for Dart developers.

## Notable Characteristics

### Built-In Asynchrony Support

Asynchronous programming is important for UI development because you don't want your UI to freeze when some time-consuming operation (e.g. network request, computationally heavy subroutines) is happening. 

There are three major ways Dart supports asynchronous programming
* [`Future`](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.7.1/dart-async/Future-class.html) object, which is very similar to [JavaScript promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
* [`Stream`](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.7.1/dart-async/Stream-class.html) object, which can be "subscribed" to
* `async` and `await` syntax

Asynchronous programming is commonly used in UI because certain operations are not instant, most common of which is HTTP requests:

```dart
import 'dart:html';

main(List<String> args) {
  Future<String> respFuture = HttpRequest.getString('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');
  respFuture.then((result) => print(result));
  print("Hello world");
}
```

<panel header="DartPad example" minimized><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 400px;" src="https://dartpad.dev/embed-inline.html?id=9dfa68887ae9b57f87d2eccfd061c675&split=50"></iframe></panel>

You should expect "Hello world" to be printed before the HTTP request's result because `Future` object makes sure that the progress of `main` will not be hindered by the HTTP request. Instead, *callback function* `(result) => print(result)` is called whenever the result is ready - thus **asynchronous**.

However it's possible to enforce the "line-by-line" execution order by using `await` in an `async` function:

```dart
import 'dart:html';

main(List<String> args) async {
  var result = await HttpRequest.getString('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');
  print(result);
  print("Hello world");
}
```

<panel header="DartPad example" minimized><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 400px;" src="https://dartpad.dev/embed-inline.html?id=1aa4acd76e7a874844564913d26a72b3&split=50"></iframe></panel>

You may understand `await` as "waiting for the result, do not proceed until it's ready". `.then` and `await` are two different ways of consuming the result of a `Future`. To help you better understand the difference between `async-await` and `then`, here is an example:

<panel header="Example">

If you are to write callback functions for futures `f1` and `f2` separately, they will execute "in parallel". You should expect to see "String from the future" before "Must come second".

```dart
main() {
  var f1 = Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1), () => 'String from the future');
  var f2 = Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), () => 'Must come second');
  f1.then((res1) => print(res1));
  f2.then((res2) => print(res2));
}
```

<panel header="DartPad example" minimized><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 400px;" src="https://dartpad.dev/embed-inline.html?id=ebdcc9d8de89c26ceed7b1255bf40395&split=50"></iframe></panel>

However, if you only want to request the content of `f2` after `f1` is ready, you may nest callback functions like below:

```dart
main() {
  var f1 = Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1), () => 'String from the future');
  var f2 = Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), () => 'Must come second');
  f1.then((res1) {
    f2.then((res2) {
      print(res1 + " " + res2);
    });
  });
}
```

<panel header="DartPad example" minimized><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 400px;" src="https://dartpad.dev/embed-inline.html?id=ff4a94d26a59c373b7cd94cd8df7094a&split=50"></iframe></panel>

This time, after 2 seconds, two strings should be printed out at the same time. However, using `async-await`, there's a more elegant way to do the same thing:

```dart
main() {
  var f1 = Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1), () => 'String from the future');
  var f2 = Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), () => 'Must come second');
  f1.then((res1) async {
    print(res1 + " " + await f2);
  });
}
```

</panel>

### Extension Methods
Extension methods aim to solve one problem: when using an external library, you may want to extend or even change some of the methods for your own needs. For example, instead of using `int.parse(42)`, you want to extend the `String` class so that it has a method `parseInt()` to parse a string to int. You can easily do so by extending `String` class in Dart:

```dart
extension NumberParsing on String {
  int parseInt() {
    return int.parse(this);
  }
}

main(List<String> args) {
  print('42'.parseInt());
}
```

<panel header="DartPad example" minimized><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 400px;" src="https://dartpad.dev/embed-inline.html?id=c162704838776bb7da6568c3c1589f69&split=50"></iframe></panel>

Extending classes, especially core classes like `String`, could be quite tricky if not impossible without extension methods. However, in Dart, you can easily customize the behavior of built-in classes like so. Extension methods in Dart have even more interesting stuff like [generic support](https://dart.dev/guides/language/extension-methods#implementing-generic-extensions).

### Named Parameters
This is what makes declarative UI code written in Dart look surprisingly similar to JSON. In a language where the order of a function's parameters is specified by the function's definition, if you only look at the function call, it might be difficult for you to figure out what those parameters mean. One classic example is the `put(key, value)` of a Map data structure - if you only see `m.put(1, 2)`, can you tell which one is key without prior knowledge?

That's when named parameters become handy:

When calling a function, you can specify named parameters using `paramName: value`. For example:
```dart
enableFlags(bold: true, hidden: false);
```

When defining a function, use `{param1, param2, ...}` to specify named parameters:
```dart
/// Sets the [bold] and [hidden] flags ...
void enableFlags({bool bold, bool hidden}) {...}
```

Note that if named parameters are used, the order no longer matters, you can write `enableFlags(hidden: false, bold: true);` as well. This feature is especially useful for declarative UI as the properties of a widget are, most of the time, parameters passed to the constructor of the object. Below is a concrete example in Flutter. Imagine how messy and frustrating the code would look like if the parameters are not named and we have to refer to the documentation for the exact order of them!

    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Welcome to Flutter',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Welcome to Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello World'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

<panel header="Optional reading: underlying implementation of *named parameters* in Dart" minimized>

Actually, **named** parameters are a type of [**optional** parameters](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour#optional-parameters) (i.e. you can omit those parameters and they will be assigned `null` or the default value upon entry of the function). You can also make use of [`@required`](https://pub.dev/documentation/meta/latest/meta/required-constant.html) annotation to make certain named parameters compulsory.

## Current State

**Tooling support**: Dart has out-of-the-box dependency management ([pub.dev](https://pub.dev/)), linting solution ([dartfmt](https://dart.dev/tools/dartfmt)), documentation generator ([dartdoc](https://dart.dev/tools/dartdoc)) and [official testing framework](https://pub.dev/packages/test). After installing Dart SDK, you're ready to go 99% of the time.

**Popularity**: Dart is a relatively new (first appeared in 2011), but quickly gained popularity in recent years: it's ranked 16th the first time it entered the [IEEE Spectrum programming language ranking](https://spectrum.ieee.org/static/interactive-the-top-programming-languages-2019), and 23rd on [TIOBE](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) as of April 2020. And Dart is being actively maintained by a team at Google: check out the [GitHub repo of Dart SDK](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk).

### Limitations

Of course, like any other language, Dart is [not perfect](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16475074). 

* Even if Dart appears to be open-sourced, it has been pretty <tooltip content="meaning the community contribution is more limited to bug fixes instead of adding new features">internally focused</tooltip>.
* And unlike Java, C++ or Python, although technically you can write most types of application using Dart, it may not be your safest choice a lot of the times (i.e. you may find yourself writing Dart in a Flutter project most of the time).

## How to Get Started With Dart?

Dart is well-documented and you should find solutions to most of your Dart problems on [their website](https://dart.dev/guides). 

Like many devs who tried Dart says, you might already know Dart. If you already have *any* prior programming experience in any language (say, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, Kotlin, Swift), you're pretty likely to master Dart within weeks for the following reasons:
* Dart is using a C-style syntax: it won't be a surprise if a function written in Java can be compiled and run in Dart with minor (or no) changes.
* Dart is a **strongly-typed** language with type-inference support: static typing makes IDE much more helpful and if your program compiles, it most likely works just fine.
* You may find your favorite syntax (sugar) in Dart, for example
  * Similar to JavaScript: arrow functions
  * Similar to Kotlin: `get` and `set` keywords for OOP, null safety syntax

### Getting Started

* Installation: You may get the Dart SDK [here](https://dart.dev/get-dart). Actually you don't even need to install the Dart SDK to play around with Dart (remember the interactive Dartpad example above?).
